# Master Duel Mod Installation Helper for Nexus Mods

Development progress for https://www.nexusmods.com/yugiohmasterduel/mods/283

This script will automate copying the file(s) to your Master Duel installation folder.
Provide your installation folder path and then choose either to install a mod or return to the original file.

## The requirement to use this script

1. You need to create two folders named "Original" and "Modded", each containing the file relevant to your mod 
2. The modded file should be inside their respective folder already (i.e file named "4bb47628" should be inside the folder "4b" and so on)
3. You need to provide the installation path of your Master Duel (one-time only now across different mods). On Steam 'right-click Master Duel icon - Manage - Browse Local Files' and then copy the address from File Manager
4. Make sure to check the images and [video example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ay0fdOYRBtE) here for proper setup
