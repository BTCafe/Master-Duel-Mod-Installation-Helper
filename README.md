# Master Duel Mod Installation Helper for Nexus Mods

Development progress for https://www.nexusmods.com/yugiohmasterduel/mods/283

This script will automate copying the file(s) to your Master Duel installation folder.
Provide your installation folder path and then choose either to install a mod or return to the original file.

## The requirement to use this script

1. You need to create two folders named "Original" and "Modded" OR "masterduel_Data", each containing the file relevant to your mod 
2. You need to provide the installation path of your Master Duel (one-time only now across different mods). On Steam 'right-click Master Duel icon - Manage - Browse Local Files' and then copy the address from File Manager
3. Make sure to check the images and [video example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ay0fdOYRBtE) here for proper setup
